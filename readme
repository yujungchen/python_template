In this repo, I list some basic python template for me to grab some code base to use.

gaussian.py : A basic template to generate 2d gaussian and random sample

gaussian3d.py : It can generate 3d gaussian sample

rndnum.py : To plot and test the exponential samples I use for rendering

lls.py : A simple linear least square code to visualize the fitted result and cost trend
